# Sentimental-Analysis-using-NLP

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

•	Programming Language: Python
•	Web Framework: Flask
•	Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Naive Bayes
•	NLP Techniques: Text preprocessing, vectorization
•	Model Deployment: REST API
•	Testing Tool: Postman


🚀 How It Works

•	User sends text input in JSON format via a POST request.
•	Flask API receives and validates the request.
•	Input text is processed using a trained ML pipeline.
•	The sentiment model predicts sentiment (Positive/Negative).
•	Prediction is returned as a JSON response.

I deployed my sentiment analysis model using Flask. I exposed a REST API that accepts text input in JSON format, processes it through a trained ML pipeline, and returns sentiment predictions as a JSON response. I also handled input validation and serialization for smooth API communication.
