# Sentimental-Analysis-using-NLP

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

Programming Language: Python
Web Framework: Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Naive Bayes
NLP Techniques: Text preprocessing, vectorization
Model Deployment: REST API
Testing Tool: Postman

🚀 How It Works

User sends text input in JSON format via a POST request.
Flask API receives and validates the request.
Input text is processed using a trained ML pipeline.
The sentiment model predicts sentiment (Positive/Negative).
Prediction is returned as a JSON response.

I deployed my sentiment analysis model using Flask. I exposed a REST API that accepts text input in JSON format, processes it through a trained ML pipeline, and returns sentiment predictions as a JSON response. I also handled input validation and serialization for smooth API communication.
